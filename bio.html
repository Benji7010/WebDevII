        <p>This is a funny I made for one of my art history classes. One of the art pices in a textbook fit well with
            the Amoung Us trend at the time so I made it.</p>
        <p>I haven't maintained any professional social media pages. I never really liked making personal or professional
            pages with public media besides comments on video sites and my own website. My network of people is
            private and I tend to prefer it that way.</p>
